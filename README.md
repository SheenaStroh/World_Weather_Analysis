# WeatherPy Map & Travel Itinerary

## Deliverable 1
In this section a set of random latitudes and longitudes was used to create a DataFrame of cities and weather information. The weather information was pulled from the OpenWeather API.

## Deliverable 2
In this section a client input section was added to filter the weather map by preferred temperatures. A list of hotels was added for each city in the preferred list, and city markers with the hotel name and weather information were added to a map.

## Deliverable 3
In this section four cities were selected to create a travel itinerary. A route map was created between those four cities using gmap directions, and the hotel and weather information were again added as markers on the map for each of the destinations.
